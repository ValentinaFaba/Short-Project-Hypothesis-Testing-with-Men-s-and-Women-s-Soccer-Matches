# Short-Project-Hypothesis-Testing-with-Men-s-and-Women-s-Soccer-Matches
I perform an appropriate hypothesis test to determine the p-value, and hence result, of whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis that the mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's. 

There are two datasets containing the results of every official men's and women's international football match since the 19th century, which is scraped from a online source. This data is stored in two CSV files: women_results.csv and men_results.csv.

I decided to limit the data used in the analysis to only official FIFA World Cup matches (not including qualifiers) since 2002-01-01. 

I assume a 10% significance level, and  I use the following null and alternative hypotheses:

 H0: The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's.

 H1: The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is greater than men's.

 
Result: With a p-value of 0.0051, which is less than the significance level, I decided to reject the initial hypothesis. At a 0.1 significance level, women's FIFA World Cup matches exhibit a greater number of goals than men's matches
